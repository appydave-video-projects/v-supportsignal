## SCENE 1: THE PAIN (0:00-0:30)
**[Visual: Split screen showing multiple scenarios simultaneously]**

### Left Screen:
- 3:00 AM - Support worker Angela in a dimly lit bedroom, dealing with a behavioral incident
- Client Sarah is distressed, Angela trying to de-escalate
- Clock ticking in corner showing time passing

### Right Screen:
- 6:00 AM - Angela at a cluttered desk, exhausted, filling paper forms
- Multiple systems open on computer: emails, Excel, incident database
- Phone ringing, sticky notes everywhere
- Text overlay: "3 hours later..."

**Voiceover (Empathetic, understanding tone):**
"Every day, support workers like Angela face critical incidents. But the real challenge comes after—spending hours documenting, reporting, chasing clarifications across multiple systems. By the time it reaches management, crucial details are lost, patterns missed, and compliance deadlines loom."

- Calendar showing "NDIS Report Due TODAY" in red
- Computer showing "427 incidents to review"
- Clock showing they've been at it for 15 hours this week
