## SCENE 1: THE PROBLEM (0:00-0:08)
**[Visual: Fast-paced montage]**
- Support worker dealing with incident at 3 AM
- Same worker hours later, drowning in paperwork
- Manager surrounded by reports, "15 HOURS THIS WEEK" overlay
- Red alert: "NDIS COMPLIANCE DUE"

**Voiceover (Urgent):**
"Support workers spend 45 minutes documenting each incident. Managers waste 15 hours weekly on compliance. Critical patterns get missed."
