## SCENE 1A: THE INCIDENT (0:00-0:10)
**SORA Prompt:**
```
Create a 10-second video scene in a residential care bedroom at 3:00 AM.
Show a caring female support worker (Angela, 30s, wearing professional scrubs)
calmly de-escalating a situation with a distressed young woman (Sarah, 20s).
The room is dimly lit with a bedside lamp. Angela is using calming gestures
and maintaining professional distance. Include a digital clock showing 3:00 AM
in the corner. The scene should feel tense but professional, showing the
reality of behavioral incident management. Camera: Medium shot, slight handheld
for authenticity. No dialogue needed, focus on body language and professional care.
```

## SCENE 1B: THE PAPERWORK NIGHTMARE (0:10-0:20)
**SORA Prompt:**
```
Create a 10-second video showing the same support worker (Angela) now at 6:00 AM,
exhausted at a cluttered office desk. Show multiple computer screens with different
systems open (email, Excel spreadsheet, database forms). Papers scattered everywhere,
sticky notes on monitor edges, coffee cup, phone ringing. Angela is typing frantically,
looking overwhelmed. Add visual effect showing clock hands spinning from 3:00 to 6:00 AM
as overlay. Text overlay: "3 hours later..." in white text. Camera: Start with wide shot
of cluttered desk, slowly zoom to Angela's tired face showing frustration.

Computer screen visible showing "427 INCIDENTS TO REVIEW" in red. Wall calendar
with "NDIS REPORT DUE TODAY" circled in red marker. Digital clock showing they've
worked 15 hours this week on compliance. Manager rubbing temples, stressed expression.

manager's stressed face. Include ticking clock sound effect.
```

## SCENE 2: TRANSFORMATION MOMENT (0:30-0:45)
**SORA Prompt:**
```
Create a 15-second transformation sequence. Start with chaotic office scene
(papers flying, multiple screens, stress) then use particle dissolution effect
where chaos transforms into organized, clean digital interface. Particles should
be NDIS blue (#1E3A8A) and reform into Support Signal logo. Add tagline
"Turning Compliance into Care" appearing letter by letter. Background transitions
from dark/cluttered to bright/clean. Include subtle sparkle/glow effects.
Music note: Transition from tense to hopeful. Camera: Static with digital effects only.

**SORA Prompt:**
```
Create 15-second scene. Angela (same support worker) now calm and confident,
at incident location holding smartphone. Close-up of her speaking clearly:
"Sarah had a behavioral incident in the bedroom at 3 AM." Show phone screen
with real-time transcription appearing word by word. Then show AI interface
highlighting and auto-filling form fields: Type: Behavioral (green checkmark),
Severity: Moderate (green checkmark), Location: Bedroom (green checkmark),
Time: 3:00 AM (green checkmark). AI generates prompt: "Was anyone injured?
What triggered the incident?" Angela continues speaking naturally.

from phone through stylized neural network. Display key insights appearing:
"REPORTABLE INCIDENT DETECTED" (red flag icon), "SIMILAR PATTERN FOUND:
Tuesday 3-5 AM high-risk window" (pattern icon), "ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
Medication timing + noise trigger" (brain icon), "PREVENTIVE ACTION:
Adjust evening routine" (shield icon). Use flowing particle effects in
NDIS blue transitioning to success green. Include subtle tech HUD elements.
Camera: Dynamic 3D movement through data visualization. Style: Modern, clean,
tech-forward but not overwhelming.
```

## SCENE 3C: EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD (1:15-1:30)
**SORA Prompt:**
```
Create 15-second scene of executive in modern office with tablet showing
Support Signal dashboard. Clean desk, professional setting. Tablet displays
live dashboard with: "0 Reportable Incidents Missed" (green), "95%+ Accuracy
in Classification" (green), "Compliance Rate: 100%" (green), heat map showing
incident patterns by location, predictive alert popup: "High risk period approaching -

5. Animated counters overlaying scenes: "15 hours → 30 minutes weekly",
   "45 minutes → 5 minutes per incident", "0 missed NDIS reportable incidents",
   "100% compliance achieved"
Each metric should animate from red (old number) to green (new number).
Camera: Smooth transitions, uplifting feel. Music: Building, positive.
```

## SCENE 5: CALL TO ACTION (1:50-2:00)
**SORA Prompt:**
```
Create 10-second closing scene. Show Support Signal interface on three devices
(phone, tablet, desktop) floating in 3D space. Devices showing different views:
incident capture, dashboard, analytics. Add animated checkmarks with text:
"✓ Mobile-first platform", "✓ AI-powered intelligence", "✓ NDIS compliant",
"✓ Real-time insights". Website URL "www.supportsignal.com.au" appears prominently.
"Book Your Free Trial Today" button with subtle pulse effect. End with logo

## ALTERNATIVE SCENE DESCRIPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT STYLES:

### ANIMATED/ILLUSTRATED VERSION:
Replace all "photorealistic" with "2D vector animation style, corporate but approachable,
similar to Slack or Notion marketing videos"

### ABSTRACT/CONCEPTUAL VERSION:
Replace character scenes with symbolic representations: use icons for workers,
flowing documents for paperwork, warning symbols for incidents, green checkmarks
for solutions. Focus on data visualization and workflow diagrams.

### TESTIMONIAL VERSION:
Add talking head segments with titles like "Angela Harvey, Support Worker" and
"Michael Chen, Compliance Manager" providing voiceover while showing platform in use.
