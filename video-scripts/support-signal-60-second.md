## SCENE 1: THE CURRENT REALITY (0:00-0:15)
**[Visual: Day in the life montage]**
- 3:00 AM: Support worker Angela managing behavioral incident with Sarah
- 6:00 AM: Angela at desk, exhausted, paper forms scattered
- Multiple browser tabs open, phone ringing
- Compliance manager's office: "427 incidents to review"
- Calendar alert: "NDIS Report Due - 2 Days"
- Text overlay: "15 hours per week on compliance"

**Voiceover (Empathetic):**
"This is the reality for NDIS providers. Critical incidents happen daily, but documenting them takes 45 minutes each. Managers spend 15 hours weekly just reviewing reports. Patterns get missed. Compliance deadlines create panic."
